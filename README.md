# The Puzzle Room Game

You are trapped in a puzzle room.  Resolve all puzzles and you will be set free.

We are a team of 4 developers and each of us created our own unique puzzles.
Player picks up different objects, interacts with buttons, shoots enemies, and teleports through space to unlock the doors of a series of puzzle rooms.
A demo of the entire game can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sIpOXeJvJHjW8tun8BwItnHLnGtWcGAX/view?usp=sharing).
